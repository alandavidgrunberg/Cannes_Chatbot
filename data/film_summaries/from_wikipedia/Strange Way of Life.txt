== Production ==
Principal photography took place in Southern Spain in August 2022, in the Tabernas Desert section of Almería. A Strange Way of Life is the title of an old Portuguese fado song by Amália Rodrigues. The filming took place with Pedro Almodóvar's own production company El Deseo in conjunction with Saint Laurent, whose head designer Anthony Vaccarello was also an associate producer and the film's costume designer. In September, Hawke confirmed, via Instagram, that the production had wrapped filming. Almódovar worked with recurring collaborators such as José Luis Alcaine (cinematography) and Alberto  Iglesias (music) whilst Teresa Font took over film editing.Speaking on the Dua Lipa podcast the director was quoted as saying "it's a queer Western, in the sense that there are two men and they love each other. It's about masculinity in a deep sense because the Western is a male genre. What I can tell you about the film is that it has a lot of the elements of the Western. It has the gunslinger, it has the ranch, it has the sheriff, but what it has that most Westerns don't have is the kind of dialogue that I don't think a Western film has ever captured between two men."


== Release ==
The film is set to premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival in May 2023. BTeam will release the film in Spanish theatres on 26 May 2023. Mubi is set to distribute the film in Italy and Latin America, while Pathé will release it in the United Kingdom.
