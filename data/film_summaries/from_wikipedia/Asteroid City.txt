In September 2020, it was reported Wes Anderson would be writing and directing a romance film, which he would produce alongside Jeremy Dawson of American Empirical Pictures and Steven Rales of Indian Paintbrush. By February 2021, Michael Cera and Jeff Goldblum entered negotiations to star in the director's next film, which was now described as being about a "group of brainy teenagers". Tilda Swinton was the first person to officially join the cast, doing so in June 2021.Principal photography, originally set for Rome, took place in Spain between August and October 2021. Several sets in Chinch√≥n, resembling a desert landscape and a mock train station, were used for the shoot. Cast member Fisher Stevens said the film would include "the wildest cast since The Bridge on the River Kwai" and that the cast and crew "were all bubbled together in a hotel, which was an old monastery".The film's title was revealed by Bill Murray to be Asteroid City at the BFI London Film Festival in October 2021. Alexandre Desplat composed the film's score in his sixth collaboration with Anderson. Costume design was by multiple Academy Award winner Milena Canonero. In July 2022, it was announced that Focus Features would distribute the film, reuniting them with Anderson after Moonrise Kingdom (2012). It was also revealed Murray would not be in the film as initially reported as a result of contracting COVID-19 before he could shoot his scenes.
