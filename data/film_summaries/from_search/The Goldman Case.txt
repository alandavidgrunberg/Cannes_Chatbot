Cédric Kahn's The Goldman Trial opens the Directors' Fortnight at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, tackling the controversial case of Pierre Goldman.
The Goldman Trial, directed by Cédric Kahn and co-written with Nathalie Hertzberg, is a drama that will be presented as the opening film at the Cannes Film Festival 2023. The film looks back at the second trial of Pierre Goldman, a far-left activist, in 1975.

Pierre Goldman, played by Arieh Worthalter, was sentenced in first instance to life imprisonment for four armed robberies, one of which led to the death of two pharmacists. Claiming his innocence, he quickly becomes the icon of the intellectual left. Georges Kiejman, played by Arthur Harari, is the young lawyer in charge of his defense. However, their relationship becomes strained over time, making the outcome of the trial uncertain.

The Goldman Trial explores the tensions between justice, politics and public opinion, offering a fascinating perspective on this controversial case. The cast also includes Maxime Canat and other talented actors.
