Paris-based sales outfit Totem Films has acquired “A Song Sung Blue,” by Chinese director Zihan Geng, and “Blackbird Blackbird Blackberry,” from Georgian filmmaker Elene Naveriani. Both films will premiere in the Directors’ Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival.

“A Song Sung Blue” is the feature debut of the Beijing-born Geng. The coming-of-age story follows 15-year-old Xian, who’s left in the care of her estranged father, a struggling photographer, after her mother is compelled to travel to Africa for work. Over the course of a restless summer, Xian befriends 18-year-old Mingmei, the daughter of his father’s assistant-turned-girlfriend, and soon finds herself looking up to the older girl.


“A Song Sung Blue” is written by Liu Yuning and produced by Jane Zheng, whose credits include Golden Globe winner “The Farewell” and the Sundance Special Jury Prize winner “Dead Pigs.” The film is co-produced by Taiwan- and France-based Justine O., whose credits include Cannes Un Certain regard selection “Streetwise.” Chinese actress Liang Jing of The Seventh Art Pictures served as executive producer.
