Discover The Settlers, historical drama by Felipe Gálvez, presented in the Un Certain Regard selection at Cannes 2023.

The Settlers, directed by Felipe Gálvez Haberle and co-written with Antonia Girardi, is a historical drama presented in the Un Certain Regard selection at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival 2023. The film, also known by its original title Los Colonos, is set in 1901, in Tierra del Fuego, Republic of Chile.

The story follows three horsemen hired by the wealthy landowner José Menendez to empty these lands of their indigenous population and open the road to the Atlantic. The ultimate goal is to "civilize" this immense and fertile territory, in accordance with the mission of the white aristocracy of the time.

Among the three horsemen, we find a young Chilean native named Segundo, who, under the orders of Lieutenant MacLennan and an American mercenary, discovers the price of building a young nation, that of blood and lies. The film explores the themes of colonization, violence and injustices suffered by the indigenous population.


The Settlers promises to offer a powerful and moving vision of the tragic events that accompanied the building of a nation. Although we have not yet had the chance to see the film, it seems that this historical drama could spark important discussions about history and collective memory.
