Les Filles d'Olfa : documentaire tunisien en compétition à Cannes 2023, un récit bouleversant

Kaouther Ben Hania's Tunisian documentary Les Filles d'Olfa, presented in competition at Cannes 2023, explores the life of a mother and her missing daughters.

Olfa's Daughters, a documentary directed by Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, will be presented in competition at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival 2023. The film offers an intimate look at the life of Olfa, a Tunisian mother of four daughters, two of whom mysteriously disappear. To tell the story of Olfa and her daughters, the director calls on professional actresses, including Hend Sabri, Nour Karoui and Ichraq Matar, and sets up a unique cinematic device, mixing documentary and fiction.

Over a period of ten years, from 2010 to 2020, the documentary follows the tumultuous life of Olfa, a forty-year-old cleaning lady from a poor background. Her two teenage daughters become radicalized, flee their home and join the Daesh terrorist organization in Libya, where they are incarcerated following an American attack. The film addresses painful themes such as denial, guilt and fear.

Olfa's Daughters raises questions about the foundations of our societies, highlighting sensitive issues such as hope, rebellion, violence, transmission and sisterhood. Olfa becomes a controversial media figure, accused of having fathered "monsters". Determined to bring her daughters back to Tunisia for trial, Olfa undertakes a poignant fight for their extradition.

Kaouther Ben Hania's documentary is distinguished by its creative and innovative approach, combining documentary and fictional elements. The narrative is carried by the point of view of actress Hend Sabri, who plays Olfa in the film.

The selection of Olfa's Daughters at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival is a testament to the international recognition of Kaouther Ben Hania's talent and the importance of this moving story. The documentary promises to move and provoke reflection in audiences around the world, while highlighting the richness and diversity of Tunisian cinema.

The Cannes Film Festival, a flagship event for international cinema, continues to be a showcase for the most outstanding works and the most promising directors. With Les Filles d'Olfa in competition, the Tunisian cinema is once again in the spotlight and participates in the influence of the film culture of the country.
