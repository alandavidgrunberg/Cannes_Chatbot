TERRESTRIAL VERSES: CANNES 2023 IS ABOUT TO DISCOVER ASGARI AND KHATAMI'S NEW FILM
Festival de Cannes Visuel générique
The mysterious Terrestrial Verses by Ali Asgari and Alireza Khatami, a highly anticipated Iranian film at Cannes 2023.

The upcoming film Terrestrial Verses, directed by Ali Asgari and Alireza Khatami, is highly anticipated in the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. For now, little information has been revealed about this mysterious Iranian film, fueling the curiosity of moviegoers around the world.

Director Ali Asgari is a regular at the Cannes Film Festival, having previously presented two short films, Bishtar Az Do Saat in 2013 and Il Silenzio in 2016. The former tells the story of a boy and girl wandering the city in search of a hospital to treat the girl, while the latter features Fatma and her mother, Kurdish refugees in Italy, confronted with Fatma's silence during a medical consultation.

Terrestrial Verses marks the first collaboration between Ali Asgari and Alireza Khatami, two talented directors whose past works have been widely acclaimed by critics and audiences alike. Their film is therefore highly anticipated, both for the quality of their work and for the promise of a bold new creation.
