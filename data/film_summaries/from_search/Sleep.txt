Cannes Critics’ Week announces selection for its 62nd edition 

From South Korea, former Bong Joon-Ho assistant Jason Yu unveils his first film Sleep (Jam). Parasite star Lee Sun-kyun star and Jung Yu-mi (Train To Busan) play newlyweds whose lives descend into horror as a result of the husband’s strange behavior while sleeping.
“Three chapters, two protagonists, a baby crying, a dog barking and a lurking phantom are the ingredients for a perfect horror comedy with a demonic efficiency,” said Cahen.
Also playing with the horror genre as well as tapping into Southeast Asia folklore, Malaysian director Amanda Eu’s coming-of-age tale Tiger Stripes explores teenage rebellion in a stifling society through the tale of a 12-year-old girl whose body starts to change at an alarming and horrifying rate as she hits puberty.
Fearing she will be labelled a monster, she tries to conceal her changed appearance until one day she decides she no longer wants to hide away.
“This fantasy film celebrates young girls’ desire for freedom and to have fun, in a society that tries hard to impose discipline,” said Cahen.
