XYZ Films have launched a new label for low-budget international genre films, called New Visions.
The company will launch its first New Visions slate at the Cannes Film Market next month with In Flames, the feature debut of Pakistani-Canadian director Zarrar Kahn. The Urdu-language horror movie, which was just picked for the Cannes Directorsâ€™ Fortnight lineup, follows a young woman and her mother, who are tormented by real and fantastic forces, following the death of the family patriarch. Other titles in the New Visions slate include the Czech science fiction title Restore Point from director Robert Hloz, and Irish folk horror All You Need Is Death from Very Extremely Dangerous helmer Paul Duane.
