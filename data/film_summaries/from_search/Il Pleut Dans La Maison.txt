One hot and stormy summer by a touristic lake, seventeen year old Purdey and her younger brother Makenzy walk the line between experiencing adolescence, finding love and fending for themselves.
While Purdey works as a cleaner in a hotel complex, Makenzy earns some money by robbing tourists. Left to their own devices, they must learn to support each other in a surprisingly tender journey that chronicles what feels like the last summer of their youth.
