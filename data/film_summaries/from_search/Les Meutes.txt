Discover Les Meutes, Kamal Lazraq's first film, in the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.
Les Meutes, the first feature film directed and written by Kamal Lazraq, will be presented in the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. The drama stars Ayoub Elaid and Abdellatif Masstouri as a father and son living in Casablanca, who are confronted with a delicate situation during a hectic night.
The film tells the story of Hassan and Issam, a father and son trying to survive in the working class suburbs of Casablanca by working for the local underworld. One night, while they are in charge of kidnapping a man, he accidentally dies in their car. With the body on their hands, they look for ways to make him disappear, leading to a long night through the underbelly of the city.
A 2011 graduate of the Fémis in Paris, Kamal Lazraq explains in an interview with Bref Cinéma magazine that this first feature film is an extension of his previous short film, Moul Lkelb (The Man with the Dog). The director wanted to explore more the urgency of a desperate quest, the wanderings in the urban margins and the encounters with strange characters.

Les Meutes was awarded the Artekino Prize at the 2019 Marrakech International Film Festival's Atlas Workshops, as well as the Gan Foundation's Creation Award in 2021. Co-produced by Barney Production (France), Mont Fleuri Production (Morocco) and Beluga Tree (Belgium), the shooting took place from October 10 to November 18, 2022 in Casablanca.
Kamal Lazraq says he was inspired by the energy of his characters and the places in Casablanca that they pass through. He wrote the film with the ambition to tell a universal story while being genuinely local, and says he was pleased with the exchange with the jury at the awards, feeling that the project was understood.
In summary, Kamal Lazraq's Les Meutes is a highly anticipated film in the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. With talented actors such as Ayoub Elaid and Abdellatif Masstouri, this drama promises to immerse viewers in a hectic night through the streets of Casablanca. Kamal Lazraq's first feature film is undoubtedly one of the films not to be missed at this edition of the festival.
