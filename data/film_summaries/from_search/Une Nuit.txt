Une Nuit d'Alex Lutz clôture Un Certain Regard au Festival de Cannes 2023

One Night, a romantic film directed and performed by Alex Lutz with Karin Viard, closes Un Certain Regard in Cannes 2023 and in theaters on July 5, 2023.

One Night, the third feature film directed by Alex Lutz, will be screened out of competition at the closing of the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. After The Talent of My Friends (2015) and Guy (2018), the French director and actor returns with this romance co-written with Karin Viard and Hadrien Bichet.

The film features the chance meeting of two strangers (played by Alex Lutz and Karin Viard) in a crowded subway train. After an argument, they end up having an intimate experience in a photo booth. As they prepare to part ways, they wonder if they should spend the night together saying goodbye.

Karin Viard, a renowned French actress, has been seen in Tokyo Shaking and Une mère or Maria Rêve. She also starred in the film Sage-Homme last March, as well as in Magnificat and Madame de Sevigne later this year.

Moviegoers and critics alike are eagerly awaiting the screening of One Night as the closing film of the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. The film is scheduled to be released in French theaters on July 5, 2023.
