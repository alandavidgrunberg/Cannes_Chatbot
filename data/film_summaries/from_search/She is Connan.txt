Written by the director, the story revolves around hellhound Rainer who roams through the abyss, narrating the six lives of Conan, who is perpetually put to death by his own future, through different eras, myths and ages; from his childhood, as a slave to Sanja and her barbarian horde, through to his accession to the heights of cruelty on the threshold to our world…
She Is Conann is produced by Luxembourg firm Les Films Fauves and French outfits Ecce Films and Floréal Films, in co-production with Orphée Films, Le Théâtre des Amandiers and Belgium’s Novak Production. The feature film also enjoys support from the Film Fund Luxembourg, among other sources, as well as an advance on receipts from the CNC and the SOFICA companies Cinémage and Cinéventure. Its release in French cinemas is entrusted to UFO Distribution, while Kinology are managing international sales.(The article continues below - Commercial information)
