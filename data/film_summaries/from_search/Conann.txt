Following his selection in Venice’s 2017 Critics’ Week via The Wild Boys [+] (the winner of the 2018 Louis-Delluc Prize for Best First Film, which was also nominated for the 2019 Lumières Awards in the same category) and in competition in Locarno 2021 via After Blue [+], Bertrand Mandico will soon be stepping onto the Croisette to take part in the 55th Directors’ Fortnight (unspooling 17 – 26 May within the 76th Cannes Film Festival) by way of his 3rd feature film She Is Conann.


A queer revisitation of the heroic fantasy character Conan the Barbarian, the film stars the American actress of Romanian descent Elina Löwensohn (the filmmaker’s usual accomplice, who won acclaim for Let the Corpses Tan [+], Black Venus [+] and Lourdes [+], among other works), Christa Theret (nominated for the 2010 and 2012 Best New Hope Césars, as well as for the 2008 and 2014 Best Newcomer and Best Actress Lumières – the latter thanks to Renoir [+] –, and named the European Film Promotion’s Shooting Star for 2013), Austria’s Julia Riedler, Claire Duburcq (who turned heads in Gold for Dogs [+]), Sandra Parfait (especially prominent in Alice and the Mayor [+]), Poland’s Agata Buzek (awarded the 2010 Best Actress Eagle for The Reverse [+], nominated last year for My Wonderful Life [+], nominated in the Best Supporting Role category in 2003 and 2017 for Agnus Dei [+], as well as in 2020 for A Coach’s Daughter [+]), Nathalie Richard (nominated for the 2021 BIFA via After Love [+], recently at her best in Neneh Superstar and in the series Irma Vep [+]), seasoned actress Françoise Brion (whose last on-screen appearance dates back to 2008, in The First Day of the Rest of Your Life [+]), Audrey Bonnet (Personal Shopper [+]) and, last but not least, Christophe Bier.

Written by the director, the story revolves around hellhound Rainer who roams through the abyss, narrating the six lives of Conan, who is perpetually put to death by his own future, through different eras, myths and ages; from his childhood, as a slave to Sanja and her barbarian horde, through to his accession to the heights of cruelty on the threshold to our world…

She Is Conann is produced by Luxembourg firm Les Films Fauves and French outfits Ecce Films and Floréal Films, in co-production with Orphée Films, Le Théâtre des Amandiers and Belgium’s Novak Production. The feature film also enjoys support from the Film Fund Luxembourg, among other sources, as well as an advance on receipts from the CNC and the SOFICA companies Cinémage and Cinéventure. Its release in French cinemas is entrusted to UFO Distribution, while Kinology are managing international sales.
