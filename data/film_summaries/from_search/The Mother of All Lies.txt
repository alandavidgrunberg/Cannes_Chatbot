Discover The Mother of All Lies, a documentary by Asmae El Moudir, in the Un Certain Regard selection at the Cannes Film Festival 2023.

The Mother of All Lies is a documentary film directed and written by the young Moroccan director Asmae El Moudir. This film, presented in the Un Certain Regard selection at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival 2023, explores the mysteries and lies surrounding Asmae's childhood.

The film begins when Asmae goes to her parents' home in Casablanca to help them move. While sorting through her old belongings, she discovers a photo of smiling children in a kindergarten yard. Almost out of frame, a little girl sitting on a bench shyly looks at the camera. Asmae is convinced that she is not the child in this picture, the only childhood memory her mother could have given her.

Determined to solve this mystery, Asmae introduces her camera and begins to question her parents, playing with this intimate incident to evoke other memories that she does not believe in either. The photo becomes the starting point of an investigation during which the director questions all the little lies her family has told her.

Throughout the documentary, Asmae explores the memory of her neighborhood and her country, Morocco, trying to understand why these lies were told and what they reveal about her family and her culture. The Mother of All Lies promises to be an intimate and moving look at family relationships and childhood memories, as well as a fascinating insight into Moroccan society.
