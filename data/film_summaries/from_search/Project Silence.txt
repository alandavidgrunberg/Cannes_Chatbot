Another Korean film has been added to this year’s selection for the Cannes International Film Festival — director Kim Tae-gon’s “Project Silence,” starring Lee Sun-kyun from “Parasite” and Ju Ji-hoon.
The organizers of the Cannes International Film Festival announced additions to this year’s selection list late Monday local time in France. “Project Silence” has been invited to the Midnight Screening section, an out-of-competition section dedicated to films that have popular appeal as well as artistic value.
“Project Silence” tells a story about people who are stranded on a collapsing bridge amid intense fog. Lee plays Cha Jung-won, a man facing disaster while trying to protect his daughter, while Ju plays Joe Park, a driver. Kim has previously produced films such as “Microhabitat” (2018), “The Queen of Crime” (2016) and “The King of Jokgu” (2013).
“As a filmmaker it is an honor to be invited to Cannes,” said Kim in a press release from CJ ENM, the main investor and distributor for “Project Silence.” “I hope our film receives good reviews from Cannes.”
This is the thirteenth time that a film invested and distributed by CJ ENM has been invited to Cannes.
With the addition of “Project Silence,” a total of five Korean films are invited to this year’s Cannes International Film Festival. Director Kim Chang-hoon’s “Hopeless,” Kim Jee-woon’s “Cobweb,” Hong Sang-soo’s “In Our Day” and Yu Ja-son’s “Sleep” are the other four films.
