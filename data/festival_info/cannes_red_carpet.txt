The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival is an upcoming film festival due to take place from 16 to 27 May 2023.

Good news for major red carpet fans: The 2023 Cannes Film Festival is officially underway in Cannes, France. The annual event, which premieres and screens some of the most-discussed films of the year, produces one of the most lavish step and repeats in the world. It’s a fashion spectacle on par with the Oscars and Met Gala, and a decidedly much more formal one than other film festivals like Venice or TIFF.
We’re bound to receive some top-tier fashion on La Croisette, thanks to a star-studded lineup of new projects. Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City stars Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Tilda Swinton, and Margot Robbie; Todd Haynes’s May December features Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman; and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro, and Brendan Fraser. If all these names aren’t enough, there’s also the 2023 Cannes jury, with members such as Brie Larson, Paul Dano, and Julia Ducournau.
Cannes has a history of delivering spellbinding style moments, after all. Glamorous moments from past years include Diana, Princess of Wales’s Catherine Walker gown in 1987, Madonna’s 1991 Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra, and Amal Clooney’s sunny Atelier Versace gown in 2016. More recently, model Bella Hadid made waves with her 2021 Schiaparelli Couture dress and gold, lung-like breastplate.
What will be the fashion mood at this year’s Cannes? There’s only one way to find out.
